turn tracker program

This program lets you keep track of the duration of spells/items in AD&D with respect to turns and rounds. You can add an item
or spell with respect to turns or rounds to a master list, which can then be decremented by either turns or rounds. Each item on
the list can be edited or removed as desired. As of now, this program assumes you are using 10 rounds to 1 turn. This is version 1 so if you find
any bugs or glitches leave a note or comment please. There might be some issues with the round system since rounds are measure 0-9 and
not 1-10. 

HOW TO RUN:
-have a current version of java
-run the .jar file

otherwise, download all the files and run timekeeper.java. There is a readme in the program under options -> help
Im new to this so you may have to download the whole thing to run the .jar, im not sure.
