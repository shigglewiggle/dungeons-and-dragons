turn tracker program

This program lets you keep track of the duration of spells/items in AD&D with respect to turns and rounds. You can add an item
or spell with respect to turns or rounds to a master list, which can then be decremented by either turns or rounds. Each item on
the list can be edited or removed as desired. This program assumes you are using 10 rounds to 1 turn. This is version 1 so if you find
any bugs or glitches leave a note or comment please. There might be some issues with the round system since rounds are measure 0-9 and
not 1-10.
